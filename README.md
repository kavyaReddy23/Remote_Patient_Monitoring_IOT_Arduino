This project makes it easy for people to book appointments with doctors online. It's like a website where you can find the right doctor for you and pick a time that works. There are three main parts: the person who manages everything (the admin), the doctors, and the patients.
The admin sets up the system by adding details about all the doctors, like what they specialize in and when they're available. Patients use the website to look for doctors who match their needs and choose a time that suits them. They then ask for an appointment. The patient can enter/ update their personal information and also add their sensor data like room temperature, body temperature, spo2, and bpm which are obtained from sensors.
Doctors can see all their appointments and decide when they're available to see patients. Plus, the system can also show important health information about patients right there on the doctor's computer. This helps doctors give the best care possible.
